Version 0.6.0  
Spaceships fly quite nicely, but right now the allied ones superpose with each other. Collision and damage are done. TODO: main menu, enemy movement and multi-spawn,
removal of leaks, movement tweaks. DESIRABLE: an interface for weapons, armor and so on, the equipment itself,  powerups.
